# GraphBLAS Languages Committee Meeting (on C++ API) - June 21, 2022

## Agenda

The conversation centered mainly around Question #3 from last week (below) about the requirements on reducers in mxm, mxv, vxm and reduce operations. Scott believes these are different from “addition” binary ops that show up in accumulate and ewise_add.  

## Minutes

We ended the conversation with something similar to the following:

DESIGN GOAL: find the right balance between maximizing the user’s “useful” flexibility while minimizing the burden on the library developer

Operator properties (traits) are in play (are there other useful ones?):
-	Unityped: A binary operator on one domain (a Magma?)
-	Associativity: sans commutativity when more than two operands exist consecutive pairs can be arbitrarily grouped as long as order maintained
-	Commutativity: means any pair of operands can be operated on in any order.  The set must be in one Domain and the operator inputs must be one type.
    - Note commutativity does not imply associativity.  I don’t know if the algebra’s are relevant in GraphBLAS
-	Identity: If it has a known identity then operator will behave as if the unstored element is of that type.
-	Annihilator: If it has a known annihilator if partial reduction achieves this value the reduction can be short circuited.
-	Idempotence: doubt this is generally useful…maybe a niche case in logical AND and OR. T^T=T, F^F=F

The BinaryOp concept
-	Does not promise any of the properties/traits 
-	I believe can be used in element-wise addition and accumulation, AND element wise multiplication and the multiply portion of matrix multiplication 
-	however an implementation is free to check for any of the properties/traits but not sure it would reasonably need to have implementation variants

Reducer concept:
-	Needs to be UniType
-	Spec could reasonable require Associativity (without checking for the trait?)
    - This allows the additions to be done out of order but the operands must stay in order. 
    - E.g., cyclic distribution is problematic without this
    - Subtraction, division, exponentiation are not associative
-	Commutativity should be encouraged (but should it be required)
    - This allows for arbitrary distribution and order of operation on data
-	Identity is not necessary 
    - This should be optional and encouraged, 
    - Could lead to more performant implementations especially parallel/distributed codes
-	Annihilator is not necessary
    - This must be optional
    - Could lead to more performant implementations in key benchmarks (i.e. BFS)

Monoid Concept is associative and has an identity (should satisfy BinaryOp and Reducer)

Commutative Monoid Concept is associative, commutative, and has an identity (should satisfy BinaryOp and Reducer)


Casting notes:
-	accumulator BinaryOp (generally): C x T -> Z, or (T1)C x (T2)T -> Z
-	mxm C<M> += AB (and mxv, vxm)
    - multiply BinaryOp: A x B -> T or (T1)A x (T2)B -> T3
    - add Reducer UniTypeBinaryOp: (T)T3 x (T)T3 -> T  (possible casting)
        - Does not really have a type constraint with the output of the multiply (each product could be cast once to T4 and a deterministic reduction is carried out in T
    - Accum BinaryOp: C x T -> Z, or (T1)C x (T2)T -> Z
    - mask: Z -> C
-	reduce C = +(A)
    - add Reducer UniTypeBinaryOp: A x A -> T (possible casting): (T)A x (T)A -> T
    - Accum BinaryOp: C x T -> Z, or (T1)C x (T2)T -> Z
    - mask: Z -> C
-	etc
