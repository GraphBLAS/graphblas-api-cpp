## Minutes

First, an interesting presentation at PLDI/ARRAY this week on mdspan unfortunately there was a problem with the recording so only the slides are available (perhaps will influence future work on hierarchical iterators for matrices): https://pldi22.sigplan.org/details?action-call-with-get-request-type=1&7c8254b9cac74799882acdf9d254f333action_174265066103ebc69eab63bbac9cb4a92cb0fd36ba4=1&__ajax_runtime_request__=1&context=pldi-2022&track=ARRAY-2022-papers&urlKey=8&decoTitle=Multidimensional-C

This week it was just Jose and I trying to answer the questions posed in the previous week (minutes below).  Assuming we don’t have a Semiring concept(still TBD), we focused on the type requirements (concepts) for the reduce and combine operators in the mxm operation. 

Regarding the “deterministic” question:
-	There are times we want random numbers (i.e. non-deterministic)…like in MIS and Louvain to break ties or perhaps in some future random walk like operation
-	Maybe the answer/language is:  “If the operators are deterministic then the operations should be deterministic”

Regarding the mxm operators.  The first and easier one is the combine operator:
-	It does not need to be commutative nor associative
-	It can be three types T1 x T2 --> T3  (whether those types are deduced by the compiler or explicitly specified by the user)
-	Casting will occur as needed and supported by the language
-	Note: if a particular cast is not supported the code will not compile
-	I believe these are the basic requirements of BinaryOp concept

The reduce conversation lasted longer
-	QUESTION #1: Must the reducer in mxm be all of one type; i.e. T x T --> T (we think so)
-	QUESTION #2: Must the reducer in mxm be of the output type produced by the combiner? (not as sure)
-	If only the we don’t have a semiring object (thus mxm is written as below), then 
    - #2 would imply there must be a requirement on the mxm operation itself that ties the type of the reducer to the output type produced by the combiner.  Or maybe it is a weaker “convertible to” requirement
    - #1 could be a requirement on mxm or captured by a new Concept (UniTypeBinaryOp?)
-	QUESTION #3: Should the reducer be associative and commutative?
    - Cutting to the chase: The math is currently defined on line 2953 of the C API 
    - In short, if the intersection set is unordered, then we believe that both associativity and commutativity are required
    - We cannot check these mathematical properties so these alone can’t be part of concept checking
    - What is clear is that we don’t require an identity to implement this, but if identity is 
    - There is a hierarchy of concepts forming
       - BinaryOp
       - UniTypeBinaryOp (restricts the types of the operands and output) and assumes commutativity and associativity
       - CommutativeMonoid (adds the existence of identity) and assume commutativity and associativity
    - If commutativity/associativity are required, then are the results undefined(?) if the operator does not satisfy that?

    - If commutativity/associativity ARE NOT required, then we will need to revisit the mathematical descriptions of the operations
